<h2>Information about game</h2>
<p>It's a simple game in which you need to click on the figure until it falls to the ground.</p>

<h3>About code</h3>
<p>Yes it works, but if you look at the code, you'll see that it's terrible. :(</p>
<p>This game was my first "serious" app on JavaScript. The code of the game needs to be recycled.</p>
